# Pre-Execution Plan: Production CI/CD Pipeline Implementation
**Date:** 2025-08-16 11:00:00
**Estimated Duration:** 2 weeks (80 hours across team)
**Priority:** Critical (Production Infrastructure)
**Project Lead:** DevOps Engineer - Riley Martinez
**Team:** DevOps (2), Security (1), SRE (1), Developer Lead (1)

## Objective
Build production-ready CI/CD pipeline for Node.js/React application with comprehensive security scanning, automated testing, blue-green deployment, and full observability stack meeting SOX compliance requirements.

## Project Context
### Current State Issues
- **Manual Deployments:** 4-hour manual deployment process with 23% failure rate
- **Security Gaps:** No automated security scanning, manual vulnerability checks taking 2 weeks
- **No Rollback Strategy:** Failed deployments require 8+ hours to recover
- **Limited Monitoring:** Basic uptime monitoring, no performance insights or SLA tracking
- **Compliance Risk:** Manual audit processes unable to meet SOX requirements

### Business Requirements
- **Deployment Frequency:** Target 5+ deployments per week (currently 1 every 2 weeks)
- **Lead Time:** Code commit to production in <2 hours (currently 3-5 days)
- **Recovery Time:** Mean time to recovery (MTTR) <30 minutes (currently 4-8 hours)
- **Security:** Automated security scanning with <24 hour vulnerability remediation
- **Compliance:** SOX-compliant audit trail and change management
