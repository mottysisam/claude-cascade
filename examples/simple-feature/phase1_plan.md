# Pre-Execution Plan: User Profile Editing
**Date:** 2025-08-16 09:00:00
**Estimated Duration:** 3-4 hours
**Priority:** Medium
**Developer:** Sarah Chen

## Objective
Implement user profile editing functionality that allows users to update their name, bio, and avatar image with real-time validation and auto-save capabilities.

## Detailed Steps
1. **Design Profile Edit Component Structure** (30 minutes)
   - Create ProfileEdit.tsx with form layout
   - Design responsive component structure
   - Plan state management approach

2. **Implement Form Fields and Validation** (1.5 hours)
   - Name field with length validation (2-50 characters)
   - Bio field with character count (max 280 characters)
   - Avatar upload with preview functionality
   - Real-time validation with user-friendly error messages

3. **API Integration** (1 hour)
   - Update existing /api/user/profile endpoint
   - Handle file upload for avatar images
   - Implement optimistic updates for better UX
   - Add proper error handling and retry logic

4. **Testing and Edge Cases** (30 minutes)
   - Component unit tests with React Testing Library
   - API integration tests
   - Edge case testing (large files, network errors, etc.)
   - Browser compatibility testing

5. **Responsive Design and Accessibility** (30 minutes)
   - Mobile-first responsive design
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Color contrast validation

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can successfully update name, bio, and avatar
- [ ] Form validation provides clear, helpful error messages
- [ ] Avatar images are compressed and optimized automatically
- [ ] Changes save automatically without explicit save button
- [ ] Component works on mobile devices (320px+ width)
- [ ] All form elements are keyboard accessible
- [ ] Screen readers can navigate the form effectively
- [ ] No console errors or warnings in development
- [ ] Page load time remains under 2 seconds
- [ ] File uploads work for images up to 5MB

## Resources Required
- **APIs**: Existing /api/user/profile endpoint (needs file upload support)
- **Libraries**: 
  - Formik or React Hook Form (form management)
  - Yup (validation schema)
  - react-dropzone (file upload)
  - react-image-crop (avatar editing)
- **Design**: Existing design system components
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library setup

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk:** File upload complexity → **Mitigation:** Use proven library (react-dropzone), implement progressive enhancement
- **Risk:** Form validation UX complexity → **Mitigation:** Start with simple validation, enhance incrementally
- **Risk:** Mobile responsive design challenges → **Mitigation:** Mobile-first approach, test early and often
- **Risk:** Image processing performance → **Mitigation:** Client-side compression, size limits, loading states

## Expected Outcomes
- Improved user engagement through easy profile customization
- Reduced support tickets about profile updates
- Foundation for future profile-related features
- Demonstration of modern form UX patterns for team

## Files to be Modified/Created
**New Files:**
- `src/components/ProfileEdit/ProfileEdit.tsx` - Main component
- `src/components/ProfileEdit/ProfileEdit.module.css` - Component styles
- `src/hooks/useProfileUpdate.ts` - Custom hook for API calls
- `src/utils/imageCompression.ts` - Image optimization utilities
- `src/types/profile.ts` - TypeScript types
- `tests/components/ProfileEdit.test.tsx` - Component tests

**Modified Files:**
- `src/api/profile.ts` - Add file upload support
- `src/pages/ProfilePage.tsx` - Integrate new component
- `src/types/api.ts` - Update API response types

## Commands to Execute
- `npm install formik yup react-dropzone react-image-crop`
- `npm run test -- --testPathPattern=ProfileEdit`
- `npm run build` (verify no build errors)
- `npm run lint` (ensure code quality)

## Verification Tests Planned
1. **Functional Testing**
   - Test successful profile updates with all field combinations
   - Verify validation messages appear correctly
   - Test avatar upload with different image formats (JPG, PNG, WebP)
   - Verify auto-save functionality works without data loss

2. **Error Handling Testing**
   - Test behavior with network errors
   - Test with oversized files (>5MB)
   - Test with invalid file formats
   - Verify graceful degradation without JavaScript

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Measure component render time
   - Test image compression efficiency
   - Verify no memory leaks with repeated uploads
   - Test with slow network conditions

4. **Accessibility Testing**
   - Keyboard-only navigation
   - Screen reader compatibility (NVDA/JAWS)
   - Color contrast validation (WCAG 2.1 AA)
   - Focus management during form interactions

5. **Cross-browser Testing**
   - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions)
   - iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile
   - Test file upload on all platforms

## Technical Approach
- **Component Architecture**: Single responsible component with custom hooks
- **State Management**: Local component state with custom hooks for API calls
- **Validation Strategy**: Schema-based validation with real-time feedback
- **File Handling**: Client-side compression before upload
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All success criteria met
- [ ] Code review approved by team lead
- [ ] All tests passing (unit, integration, accessibility)
- [ ] Performance metrics within acceptable range
- [ ] Documentation updated (component docs, API changes)
- [ ] Feature flag enabled for gradual rollout
