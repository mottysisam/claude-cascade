# Pre-Execution Plan: E-commerce Cart System Modernization
**Date:** 2025-08-16 10:00:00
**Estimated Duration:** 3 weeks (120 hours across team)
**Priority:** High (Critical Business System)
**Project Lead:** Alex Rodriguez
**Team:** Frontend (2), Backend (2), DevOps (1), QA (1)

## Objective
Modernize legacy e-commerce cart system from jQuery/PHP to React/TypeScript stack while achieving 40% performance improvement and maintaining 100% functional compatibility during transition.

## Project Context
### Current System Issues
- **Performance:** Cart page loads in 3.2 seconds (target: 1.8 seconds)
- **Maintainability:** 8,000 lines of mixed jQuery/PHP code with minimal documentation
- **Mobile Experience:** Poor mobile UX with 68% mobile cart abandonment rate
- **Accessibility:** WCAG compliance gaps causing legal risk exposure
- **Development Velocity:** New features take 3x longer due to legacy complexity

### Business Impact
- **Revenue Risk:** $2.1M monthly cart revenue at risk during migration
- **Performance Impact:** 12% conversion rate improvement expected with faster cart
- **Developer Productivity:** 60% faster feature development post-migration
- **Compliance:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required by Q4 legal deadline
