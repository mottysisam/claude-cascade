# üìã Template Guide for Claude Cascade

*Master the art of consistent, effective planning documentation*

## üéØ Template Philosophy

Templates in Claude Cascade aren't rigid forms‚Äîthey're **thinking frameworks** that guide you toward complete, actionable plans while maintaining consistency across your team.

## üìö Built-in Template Overview

Claude Cascade includes three core templates, each optimized for its specific phase:

### Phase 1: Pre-Execution Planning Template
**Purpose**: Structure your thinking before implementation
**Location**: `~/.claude-cascade/templates/phase1-pre-exec.md`

### Phase 2: Post-Execution Reporting Template  
**Purpose**: Capture what actually happened during implementation
**Location**: `~/.claude-cascade/templates/phase2-post-exec.md`

### Phase 3: Delta Verification Template
**Purpose**: Systematically verify completion and quality
**Location**: `~/.claude-cascade/templates/phase3-verification.md`

## üõ†Ô∏è Using Templates Effectively

### Quick Template Usage

```bash
# Copy template to your project
cp ~/.claude-cascade/templates/phase1-pre-exec.md .claude/plans/1_pre_exec_plans/20250816_143000_MY_FEATURE.md

# Edit with your favorite editor
vim .claude/plans/1_pre_exec_plans/20250816_143000_MY_FEATURE.md
```

### Template Variables

All templates include placeholders you should replace:

- `[PLAN_NAME]` ‚Üí Your descriptive plan name
- `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` ‚Üí Current timestamp
- `[X hours/days]` ‚Üí Your time estimate
- `[High/Medium/Low]` ‚Üí Priority level
- `[Description]` ‚Üí Your specific content

## üîß Advanced Template Features

### Dynamic Template Selection

Create a template chooser script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# cascade-template-chooser.sh

echo "Select template type:"
echo "1) Frontend Feature"
echo "2) Backend API"
echo "3) DevOps/Infrastructure"
echo "4) Bug Fix"
echo "5) Refactoring"

read -p "Enter choice (1-5): " choice

case $choice in
    1) template="frontend-feature.md" ;;
    2) template="backend-api.md" ;;
    3) template="devops-infra.md" ;;
    4) template="bug-fix.md" ;;
    5) template="refactoring.md" ;;
    *) echo "Invalid choice"; exit 1 ;;
esac

cp ~/.claude-cascade/templates/$template .claude/plans/1_pre_exec_plans/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)_${1:-NEW_PLAN}.md
echo "Template created: .claude/plans/1_pre_exec_plans/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)_${1:-NEW_PLAN}.md"
```

### Template Validation

Add validation scripts to ensure template completeness:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# validate-phase1-plan.sh

plan_file="$1"

if [ ! -f "$plan_file" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå Plan file not found: $plan_file"
    exit 1
fi

# Check required sections
required_sections=("## Objective" "## Detailed Steps" "## Success Criteria" "## Verification Tests Planned")
missing_sections=()

for section in "${required_sections[@]}"; do
    if ! grep -q "$section" "$plan_file"; then
        missing_sections+=("$section")
    fi
done

if [ ${#missing_sections[@]} -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "‚úÖ Phase 1 plan validation passed"
    exit 0
else
    echo "‚ùå Phase 1 plan validation failed. Missing sections:"
    printf '%s\n' "${missing_sections[@]}"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Template Metrics

Track template usage and effectiveness:

```bash
# Add to your templates
## Template Metrics (Auto-populated)
**Template Version:** v2.1
**Completion Time:** [Auto-calculated by hooks]
**Success Rate:** [Based on verification results]
**Team Adoption:** [Usage statistics]
```

## üìä Template Analytics

### Measuring Template Effectiveness

Track these metrics to improve your templates:

1. **Completion Rate**: What percentage of plans complete all three phases?
2. **Quality Score**: How well do plans meet their success criteria?
3. **Time Accuracy**: How close are estimates to actual time?
4. **Issue Prevention**: How many bugs are caught in verification?

### Template Evolution

Continuously improve templates based on:

```bash
# Generate template usage report
cascade analytics --template-usage

# Example output:
# Template Usage Report
# =====================
# frontend-feature.md: 23 uses, 87% completion rate
# backend-api.md: 18 uses, 92% completion rate
# devops-infra.md: 12 uses, 67% completion rate
# 
# Recommendations:
# - devops-infra.md has low completion rate, consider simplifying
# - backend-api.md is most successful, use as model for others
```

## üèÜ Template Best Practices

### Do's

‚úÖ **Keep templates focused**: Each template should serve one specific purpose
‚úÖ **Use clear language**: Avoid jargon and ambiguous terms
‚úÖ **Include examples**: Show what good completion looks like
‚úÖ **Make sections optional**: Mark nice-to-have vs. required sections
‚úÖ **Version your templates**: Track changes and improvements over time

### Don'ts

‚ùå **Don't over-engineer**: Simple templates are more likely to be used
‚ùå **Don't make them too long**: Long templates discourage completion
‚ùå **Don't include everything**: Focus on what's essential for this phase
‚ùå **Don't forget maintenance**: Update templates based on team feedback
‚ùå **Don't ignore adoption**: If templates aren't used, they need improvement

### Template Adoption Strategy

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic templates, add complexity gradually
2. **Lead by Example**: Use templates consistently yourself
3. **Gather Feedback**: Regularly ask team for template improvement suggestions
4. **Measure Success**: Track completion rates and quality improvements
5. **Iterate Quickly**: Make small, frequent improvements rather than major overhauls

## üîÑ Template Maintenance

### Regular Review Schedule

**Monthly**: Review template usage statistics
**Quarterly**: Gather team feedback on template effectiveness
**Bi-annually**: Major template updates based on learned best practices

### Template Version Control

Keep templates in version control:

```bash
# Create templates repository
git init ~/.claude-cascade/templates
cd ~/.claude-cascade/templates
git add .
git commit -m "Initial template set v1.0"

# Tag versions
git tag v1.0

# Track changes
git log --oneline
```

### Sharing Templates

Share successful templates with the community:

```bash
# Export your templates for sharing
cascade templates export --format zip

# Import templates from others
cascade templates import team-templates.zip
```

## üåü Community Templates

### Contributing Templates

1. **Test thoroughly**: Use template for at least 5 real projects
2. **Document usage**: Include when and how to use the template
3. **Provide examples**: Show completed templates in action
4. **Follow conventions**: Use standard naming and structure

### Template Repository

The Claude Cascade community maintains templates for:

- **Industry-specific**: FinTech, HealthTech, Gaming, etc.
- **Technology-specific**: React, Node.js, Python, Go, etc.
- **Process-specific**: Bug fixes, security updates, migrations, etc.
- **Scale-specific**: Solo developer, small team, enterprise, etc.

## üéØ Conclusion

Effective templates are the foundation of successful Claude Cascade adoption. They:

- **Reduce cognitive load** by providing structure
- **Ensure consistency** across team members
- **Capture institutional knowledge** in reusable form
- **Improve over time** through measurement and iteration

Remember: The best template is the one your team actually uses. Start simple, measure effectiveness, and evolve based on real usage patterns.
