## üèóÔ∏è Technical Setup for Teams

### Shared Configuration Management

#### Option 1: Project-Level Configuration

```bash
# Create project-specific Cascade configuration
mkdir .cascade-config

# Shared templates for the project
cp ~/.claude-cascade/templates/* .cascade-config/templates/

# Project-specific template customizations
vim .cascade-config/templates/phase1-pre-exec.md

# Shared configuration file
cat > .cascade-config/team-config.json << EOF
{
  "team_name": "Frontend Squad",
  "default_templates": {
    "frontend": "frontend-feature.md",
    "backend": "backend-api.md",
    "infra": "devops-infra.md"
  },
  "required_reviewers": {
    "security": ["@security-team"],
    "performance": ["@lead-developer"],
    "design": ["@ux-team"]
  },
  "compliance_targets": {
    "completion_rate": 85,
    "quality_score": 80,
    "verification_success": 90
  }
}
EOF

# Git integration
echo ".cascade-config/" >> .gitignore
git add .cascade-config/
git commit -m "Add team Cascade configuration"
```

#### Option 2: Shared Repository Approach

```bash
# Create team configuration repository
git clone https://github.com/yourteam/cascade-config.git ~/.cascade-team-config

# Link team config to individual installations
ln -s ~/.cascade-team-config/templates ~/.claude-cascade/team-templates
ln -s ~/.cascade-team-config/config.json ~/.claude-cascade/team-config.json

# Sync updates
cd ~/.cascade-team-config
git pull origin main
```

### Multi-Project Team Setup

```bash
# Configure different teams/projects
cascade config team add --name "backend-team" --config backend-team.json
cascade config team add --name "frontend-team" --config frontend-team.json
cascade config team add --name "devops-team" --config devops-team.json

# Switch between team contexts
cascade config team use backend-team

# Team-specific commands
cascade status --team backend-team
cascade analytics --team frontend-team
```

## üìã Team Workflow Patterns

### Pattern 1: Individual Ownership

**Best for**: Small teams (2-4 people), experienced developers, independent features

**Workflow**:
1. Individual creates Phase 1 plan
2. Optional peer review of plan before execution
3. Individual executes and documents Phase 2
4. Individual or peer performs Phase 3 verification
5. Team review of completed workflow (retrospective)

**Example Process**:
```bash
# Developer A creates plan
cascade init feature user-profile-edit
vim .claude/plans/1_pre_exec_plans/20250816_140000_USER_PROFILE_EDIT.md

# Optional: Peer review via Pull Request
git add .claude/plans/1_pre_exec_plans/20250816_140000_USER_PROFILE_EDIT.md
git commit -m "Add Phase 1 plan for user profile editing"
gh pr create --title "Plan Review: User Profile Edit" --body "Please review planning approach"

# After approval, implement feature
# ... development work ...

# Document execution
vim .claude/plans/2_post_exec_plans/20250816_140000_USER_PROFILE_EDIT_EXECUTED.md

# Verification (can be done by peer)
vim .claude/plans/3_checked_delta_exec_plans/20250816_140000_USER_PROFILE_EDIT_VERIFICATION.md
```

### Pattern 2: Collaborative Planning

**Best for**: Medium teams (5-8 people), complex features, cross-functional work

**Workflow**:
1. Team collaboratively creates Phase 1 plan in planning session
2. Multiple team members implement different parts
3. Each implementer documents their Phase 2 work
4. Designated team member consolidates Phase 3 verification
5. Team retrospective on overall workflow

**Example Process**:
```bash
# Team planning session
# Multiple people contribute to single plan or create linked plans

# Plan A: Backend API
cascade init feature user-auth-api --owner backend-team
# Plan B: Frontend Integration  
cascade init feature user-auth-ui --owner frontend-team --dependency user-auth-api

# Link related plans
echo "**Related Plans:** user-auth-ui.md" >> .claude/plans/1_pre_exec_plans/user-auth-api.md
echo "**Dependencies:** user-auth-api.md" >> .claude/plans/1_pre_exec_plans/user-auth-ui.md
```

### Pattern 3: Pair/Mob Programming with Cascade

**Best for**: Knowledge sharing, complex problems, onboarding

**Workflow**:
1. Pair/mob creates Phase 1 plan together
2. Pair/mob implements together with real-time Phase 2 documentation
3. Immediate Phase 3 verification as part of session
4. Shared learning and knowledge transfer

**Example Process**:
```bash
# Start pair programming session with planning
cascade init feature complex-algorithm --mode pair --participants "alice,bob"

# Real-time documentation during implementation
cascade note "Discovered edge case with empty arrays, adding validation"
cascade note "Performance bottleneck identified in loop, refactoring to use map"

# Immediate verification
cascade verify --live-session
```

## üîÑ Integration with Existing Tools

### Git Integration

#### Pre-commit Hooks

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Check for incomplete workflows
incomplete_workflows=$(cascade status --incomplete --count)

if [ "$incomplete_workflows" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Warning: $incomplete_workflows incomplete workflows detected"
    echo "Run 'cascade status' for details"
    echo ""
    echo "Continue anyway? (y/N)"
    read -r response
    if [[ ! "$response" =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
        exit 1
    fi
fi

# Validate plan quality for committed plans
for plan_file in $(git diff --cached --name-only | grep -E '\.claude/plans/.*\.md$'); do
    if ! cascade validate "$plan_file"; then
        echo "‚ùå Plan validation failed: $plan_file"
        exit 1
    fi
done
```
