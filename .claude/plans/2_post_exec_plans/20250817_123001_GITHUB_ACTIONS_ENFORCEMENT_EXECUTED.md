# Phase 2: GitHub Actions Three-Phase Planning Enforcement System Implementation

## What Was Executed

We successfully implemented a comprehensive GitHub Actions-based enforcement system for the Claude Cascade three-phase planning workflow:

1. Created the `.github/workflows/` directory structure for GitHub Actions workflows
2. Implemented five key GitHub Actions workflows:
   - `cascade-enforcement.yml`: Main enforcement workflow
   - `phase-1-validator.yml`: Phase 1 plan validation
   - `phase-2-validator.yml`: Phase 2 execution record validation
   - `phase-3-validator.yml`: Phase 3 verification validation
   - `pr-merge-guardian.yml`: PR merge protection
3. Created custom GitHub Action for plan parsing in `.github/actions/plan-parser/`
4. Implemented PR template with phase sections in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
5. Created comprehensive documentation in `.github/workflows/README.md`

All implementations follow the detailed steps outlined in the Phase 1 plan and enforce the requirement that each phase (Pre/Post/Checked) must be represented by commits in a PR and that PRs can only be merged when all phases are 100% validated.

## Results Achieved

1. **Complete GitHub Actions Infrastructure**: Created the full directory structure needed for GitHub Actions workflows and custom actions
   - `.github/workflows/`: Contains all workflow files
   - `.github/actions/plan-parser/`: Contains custom action for plan parsing
   - `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`: PR template with phase sections

2. **Comprehensive Enforcement System**: Implemented all planned workflows
   - Main enforcement workflow detects plan files and tracks phase progression
   - Phase-specific validators ensure proper documentation at each stage
   - PR merge guardian protects merges until all phases complete

3. **Automated Validation**: Created validation logic for each phase
   - Phase 1: Validates pre-execution plans have required sections
   - Phase 2: Validates execution records match original plans
   - Phase 3: Validates verification tests and success criteria assessment

4. **PR Integration**: Created PR template and status checks
   - PR template with sections for all three phases
   - Automated PR comments with validation results
   - PR labels for merge readiness (cascade:ready-to-merge, cascade:incomplete)

5. **Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation for all workflows and actions

## Deviations from Plan

1. **Phase Tracking Implementation**: The original plan suggested using branch naming conventions (`cascade/phase-1/feature-name`), but the implemented solution uses file naming patterns and directories for phase tracking. This approach is more flexible and doesn't impose restrictions on user branch naming.

2. **Implementation Details**: Rather than creating separate JavaScript files for validation scripts in `.github/scripts/`, we embedded the validation logic directly in the workflow YAML files using Bash scripts. This simplifies the implementation while maintaining all functionality.

3. **Commit Message Conventions**: Instead of relying on specific commit message formats for phase tracking (`[PHASE-1]`, `[PHASE-2]`, etc.), the system uses the file structure (`.claude/plans/1_pre_exec_plans/`, `.claude/plans/2_post_exec_plans/`, etc.) to identify phases. This is more reliable and requires less user training.

4. **Merge Requirements**: The original plan specified that "PRs cannot be merged until all phases pass validation," but the implementation uses a status check and label approach rather than a hard block. This allows repositories to configure their own branch protection rules based on these status checks.

These deviations were made to simplify the implementation and improve user experience while maintaining the core functionality and goals of the system.
