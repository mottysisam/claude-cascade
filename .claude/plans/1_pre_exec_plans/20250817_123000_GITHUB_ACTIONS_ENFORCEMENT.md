# Phase 1: GitHub Actions Three-Phase Planning Enforcement System

## Objective
Implement a bulletproof GitHub Actions-based enforcement system for the Claude Cascade three-phase planning workflow that ensures each phase (Pre/Post/Checked) is represented by commits in a PR and that PRs can only be merged when all phases are 100% validated.

## Context
Claude Cascade requires a reliable way to enforce the three-phase planning workflow:
1. **Pre-Execution Plan**: Document intentions before acting
2. **Post-Execution Recording**: Capture what actually happened
3. **Delta Verification**: Validate completion and quality

Currently, the project has local git hooks but lacks GitHub-based enforcement to ensure PR-level compliance.

## Detailed Steps

### 1. GitHub Actions Infrastructure
- Create `.github/workflows/` directory structure
- Create `.github/actions/` directory for custom actions
- Create `.github/scripts/` directory for validation scripts
- Create `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` with phase sections

### 2. Core Enforcement Workflows
- Implement `cascade-enforcement.yml` as main enforcement workflow
  - Trigger on PR open, push, and commit events
  - Validate plan file existence and structure
  - Track phase progression through commit messages
- Create phase-specific validation workflows:
  - `phase-1-validator.yml`: Validates pre-execution plans
  - `phase-2-validator.yml`: Validates post-execution records
  - `phase-3-validator.yml`: Validates verification tests
- Implement `pr-merge-guardian.yml` to protect merges

### 3. Custom GitHub Actions
- Develop `plan-parser` action to extract plan metadata
- Develop `phase-tracker` action to track phase completions
- Develop `compliance-checker` action for overall validation

### 4. Branch Protection Rules
- Configure branch protection via GitHub API
- Enforce status checks for all phases
- Require PR reviews

### 5. Developer Experience
- Update VSCode extension to support new GitHub Actions
- Add commands to CLI for workflow interaction
- Create visualization for phase status

### 6. Documentation
- Document all new GitHub Actions workflows
- Create examples for users
- Update README with new enforcement system details

## Implementation Requirements

### GitHub Actions Workflow Files
- `cascade-enforcement.yml`: Main enforcement workflow
- `phase-1-validator.yml`: Pre-execution validation
- `phase-2-validator.yml`: Post-execution validation
- `phase-3-validator.yml`: Delta verification validation
- `pr-merge-guardian.yml`: Final merge protection

### Custom GitHub Actions
- `plan-parser`: Extracts data from plan files
- `phase-tracker`: Monitors phase completion
- `compliance-checker`: Overall compliance validation

### Branch Naming Conventions
- `cascade/phase-1/feature-name`: Pre-execution plan branch
- `cascade/phase-2/feature-name`: Post-execution record branch
- `cascade/phase-3/feature-name`: Verification branch

### Commit Message Conventions
- Phase 1: `[PHASE-1] Add pre-execution plan for <feature>`
- Phase 2: `[PHASE-2] Add post-execution record for <feature>`
- Phase 3: `[PHASE-3] Add verification for <feature>`

## Success Criteria
- GitHub Actions successfully block PRs with incomplete phases
- Each phase is represented by a commit in the PR
- PRs cannot be merged until all phases pass validation
- Dashboard accurately shows phase completion status
- System integrates with existing Claude Cascade components
- Performance impact is minimal (validation completes in < 30 seconds)

## Metrics for Success
- 100% of merged PRs have all three phases complete
- 0% bypass rate (no PRs merge without full validation)
- Developer satisfaction survey shows > 80% positive feedback
- Time to complete validation is < 30 seconds for most repositories
- System handles edge cases (merge conflicts, reverts, hotfixes)

## Dependencies
- GitHub API access for branch protection rules
- Node.js for validation scripts
- GitHub Actions workflow syntax
- GitHub repository permissions for workflow setup

## Timeline
- Setup infrastructure: 1 day
- Core enforcement workflows: 2 days
- Custom GitHub Actions: 2 days
- Testing and validation: 1 day
- Documentation: 1 day
- Total: 7 days

## Testing Approach
- Create test PRs with various phase combinations
- Attempt to bypass enforcement in multiple ways
- Test with different repository sizes
- Validate performance metrics
- Gather user feedback on workflow experience
