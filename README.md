> *Where intelligent planning workflows cascade through every phase of development*

Claude Cascade transforms how you plan, execute, and verify work with Claude Code by introducing a sophisticated three-phase workflow system that ensures nothing falls through the cracks.

## 🎯 Why Claude Cascade?

### The Problem
Development teams using Claude Code often struggle with:
- **Lost Context**: Plans discussed but never documented
- **Incomplete Workflows**: Execution without proper verification
- **Team Misalignment**: No shared understanding of what was actually done
- **Quality Gaps**: Missing validation steps lead to production issues

### The Solution
Claude Cascade implements a **three-phase planning workflow** that transforms chaotic development into systematic, traceable processes:

1. **🎯 Phase 1 - Pre-Execution Planning**: Document intentions before acting
2. **⚡ Phase 2 - Post-Execution Recording**: Capture what actually happened  
3. **🔍 Phase 3 - Delta Verification**: Validate completion and quality

## ✨ Key Features

### 🤖 **Intelligent Monitoring**
- **Keyword Detection**: Automatically detects planning opportunities in conversations
- **File Operation Tracking**: Monitors significant code changes
- **Command Analysis**: Identifies deployment and infrastructure operations
- **Smart Reminders**: Non-intrusive guidance for workflow compliance

### 📊 **Analytics & Insights**
- **Compliance Tracking**: Monitor workflow completion rates across teams
- **Productivity Metrics**: Understand planning effectiveness over time
- **Quality Scoring**: Automated assessment of plan completeness
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify patterns in successful project delivery

### 🛠 **Seamless Integration**
- **Claude Code Hooks**: Native integration with Claude Code's hook system
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows
- **One-Click Installation**: Automated setup with backup and rollback
- **CLI Tools**: Command-line utilities for project management

### 📋 **Professional Templates**
- **Structured Planning**: Pre-built templates for each workflow phase
- **Quality Checklists**: Built-in validation criteria and success metrics
- **Verification Tests**: Standardized approaches to completion validation
- **Documentation Standards**: Consistent formatting across all projects

### 📋 **Phase 1: Pre-Execution Planning**
*Document your intentions before you act*

```markdown
# Pre-Execution Plan: User Authentication System
**Date:** 2024-08-16 14:30:00
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Duration:** 4 hours

## Objective
Implement secure user authentication with JWT tokens and role-based access control

## Detailed Steps
1. Set up JWT authentication middleware
2. Create user registration endpoint
3. Implement login/logout functionality
4. Add role-based route protection
5. Write comprehensive tests

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can register with email/password
- [ ] JWT tokens issued on successful login
- [ ] Protected routes reject unauthorized access
- [ ] All tests pass with >90% coverage

## Verification Tests Planned
- Unit tests for auth middleware
- Integration tests for auth endpoints
- Security penetration testing
```

### 📝 **Phase 2: Post-Execution Report**
*Record what actually happened*

```markdown
# Post-Execution Report: User Authentication System
**Date:** 2024-08-16 18:45:00
**Status:** Completed
**Actual Duration:** 5.5 hours

## What Was Executed
- Implemented JWT middleware using jsonwebtoken library
- Created user registration with bcrypt password hashing
- Added login endpoint with rate limiting
- Implemented role-based middleware for admin routes
- Wrote 47 test cases with 94% coverage

## Deviations from Plan
- Added rate limiting (not originally planned)
- Used bcrypt instead of planned argon2 (better ecosystem support)
- Extended testing beyond planned scope

## Issues Encountered
- CORS configuration needed adjustment for frontend integration
- Initial JWT secret generation was not secure enough
- Database connection pooling required optimization

## Results Achieved
- Authentication system fully functional
- All planned features implemented plus security enhancements
- Test coverage exceeds target (94% vs 90%)
```

### 🔍 **Phase 3: Delta Verification**
*Validate completion and quality*

```markdown
# Delta Verification Report: User Authentication System
**Date:** 2024-08-16 19:30:00
**Verification Status:** Pass

## Verification Tests Performed

### Test 1: Authentication Flow
- **Command:** `npm test -- auth.test.js`
- **Expected:** All tests pass
- **Actual:** 47/47 tests pass ✅
- **Status:** Pass

### Test 2: Security Validation
- **Command:** `npm audit && npm run security-scan`
- **Expected:** No vulnerabilities
- **Actual:** 0 vulnerabilities found ✅
- **Status:** Pass

### Test 3: Integration Testing
- **Command:** `npm run test:integration`
- **Expected:** Frontend can authenticate
- **Actual:** All integration flows working ✅
- **Status:** Pass

## Final Status
- **Plan Execution:** Successful
- **All Tests Passed:** Yes
- **Ready for Production:** Yes
```
